# DS_112_Project
Authors: Shelly Bai & Yair Castillo Palacios 

Our main code document is located in our projectreport.rmd file, with the final versions of our visualizations.
The resources folder contains the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative data that our visualizations pulled from.
Our presentation document is presentation.qmd, containing some of the visuals we used. The presentation files foldor includes the resources needed when displaying the presentation outside of this repository.
The App-1 folder contains the remnants of a shiny file with the interactive leaflet map that wasn't included in the presentation, as the base leaflet file was sufficient on its own.

The other documents in the repository are extemporaneous documents we used while  working wrangling and presentation of our data (data_wrangle_01.rmd, YairViz.rmd, dashboard.rmd), they have been left in in case of further edits, but they are not part of our main work.

Thank you for taking a look at our project!
