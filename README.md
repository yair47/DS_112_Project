# DS_112_Project
Authors: Shelly Bai & Yair Castillo Palacios 

* Our main code document is located in our projectreport.rmd file, with the final versions of our visualizations.
* The resources folder contains the Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative data that our visualizations pulled from.

* The App-1 folder contains a functioning Shiny app with the ability to select specific indicator data to be displayed geographically by country. The map wasn't included in the presentation, as the base leaflet code was sufficient on its own in the document.

* Shiny app here: https://shellybaistats.shinyapps.io/FinalProjCompStat112/

* Our presentation document is presentation.qmd, containing some of the visuals we used. The presentation files folder includes the resources needed when displaying the presentation outside of this repository.

The other documents in the repository are extemporaneous documents we used while  working wrangling and presentation of our data (data_wrangle_01.rmd, YairViz.rmd, dashboard.rmd), they have been left in the repo for now, but they are not part of our main work.

Thank you for taking a look at our project!
